Gonna sing you one more love song
While I'm feeling this way
Where your mind sometimes protect you
But your heart won't do the same

So I'm down on my knees
Put my problem in God's hand
Give me the strength to carry on
And heart to understand

I'll love you forever till the end of all time
Past all infinity, babe I'm dying
To love you forever, oh, say that your mine
Sweet Holy Trinity at the end of a line

Well, baby, I'm trying
I'm trying to understand
Well, I'm trying to stand back far enough
To see the master plan

Gonna say it one more time
Then I guess I'll just let it stand
For the least that I can say
Is Heaven is in your hand

I'll love you forever till the end of all time
Past all infinity, babe I'm dying
To love you forever, just say that your mine
Sweet Holy Trinity at the end of a line

Well, baby, I'm trying
Trying to understand
Trying to stand back far enough
To see the master plan

Gonna say it one more time, then I guess
Then I guess I'll just let it stand
But the least that I can say
Is Heaven is in your hand

I'll love you forever till the end of all time
Past all infinity, oh, baby I'm dying
To love you forever, just say that your mine
Sweet Holy Trinity at the end of a line
Sweet Holy Trinity at the end of a line
