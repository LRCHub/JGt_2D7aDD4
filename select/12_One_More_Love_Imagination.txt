Every cloud has a silver lining
Every ship sail on silver sea
Every man can climb highest
mountain
What about me
I hear the sound of something
in your voices
That a million brace that certain tone
Just when you confuse me
I understand that i dont know
i dont know
Could i been thinking more than i should
Am hoping for something i cant have
I Made it mistake of thinking
What not there
Someone somewhere tell me please
One more love
To take me, take me higher
One more love
Tell me touch the sky
One more love to take me
One more love ooh
One more one more aah
One more love
Could i been thinking
more than i should
Am i hoping for something
i cant have
I made a mistake of thinking
Was not there
Someone somewhere
tell me please
One more love to take me take me higher
One more love tell me touch the sky
One more love to take me
One more love ahhh
One more one more aahh
by ri ya na ooh
One more love by ri ya na ooh
